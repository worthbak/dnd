### Ship Combat Rules Overview

- Combat occurs on hex grid with ships moving minimum 1 hex per turn
- Ships limited to 2 “clock tick” turns per standard move
- Knight’s Fortune stats:
  - 3 action points per turn
  - “Come about” action costs 2 points but allows 90-degree turn
  - Broadside attacks get full damage, fore/aft attacks reduced
  - Ship repair action takes full turn but recovers 8 HP
  - Ships become “stressed” at half HP, receiving disadvantage on checks

### Knight’s Fortune Special Capabilities

- Jolly Raj gave a tour - i should write up specifics for this stuff
- 16 total cannons (8 per side)
- 3 “PAPs” (Portable Underwater People Movers):
  - Allow 2 people each to move through ship hulls underwater
  - Create air bubble for limited underwater breathing
  - ~30 ft movement per turn
- Enhanced crow’s nest (“God’s nest”):
  - Allows misty step between ships up to 300 ft
  - Provides tactical advantage for ranged attacks
- Defensive capabilities need improvement per ship’s bosun

### Character Combat Updates

- Party reached Level 5
- Tav’s current stats:
  - +15 to hit (needs balancing adjustment to ~+11)
  - 4 attacks per turn capability
- Oz’s capabilities:
  - +9 to hit with crossbow
  - 3d6 sneak attack damage at level 5
- Dorum’s needs:
  - Currently +6 to hit (needs improvement)
  - New magical great axe planned

### Ship Capture Operation

- Successfully infiltrated Sodranian ship using PAPs
- Killed cook and assistant in initial encounter
- Defeated 7 crew members on gun deck
- Captured ship’s captain through intimidation
- Secured surrender of remaining 8 crew members
- Night’s Fortune maintained distance flying white flag

### Character Developments

- Oz experiencing dreams about:
  - Vaporeon - emotions of fear/pain/confusion
  - Vision of elven queen wearing Obsidian Helm
- Tav focused on:
  - Rescuing Vaporeon
  - Concerns about pirate crew reliability
- Dorum:
  - Lost 275 gold gambling with Silvershade (blackjack)
  - Retrieved pistol through intimidation in the end
  - Silvershade was into it when Dolrum asserted his power over her and took the pistol - they had a moment
    - Silvershade, half-elven woman, cockney accent?

### Magical Items & Equipment

- Tav received from [[Eliza Glembus]]:
  - +2 short sword
  - Enhanced helm (+2 AC)
  - +2 light crossbow
- Oz received:
  - Upgraded crossbow (+9 to hit)
  - Pistol (1d10 damage, grants advantage)
  - Eliza threw “Sheila”, Oz’s old crossbow, out of a window, damaging it - Thaddeus roughly repaired it and presented it to Oz, who was pissed that it was broken, even when receiving a better one

### Strategic Planning

- Need to investigate why ship capture was unexpectedly easy
- Must balance character combat capabilities
- Plan to improve Dorum’s offensive abilities
- Consider defensive upgrades for Knight’s Fortune

### Next Steps

- Next session scheduled for May 4th
- Need to:
  - Balance Tav’s combat bonuses
  - Upgrade Dorum’s equipment
  - Investigate captured ship’s mission
  - Address Knight’s Fortune defensive capabilities

Key findings from Crutchley's documents:

- Communications with Sudranians showing they treated him as a contractor, providing minimal support beyond what was necessary

- Rough sketches of the Obsidian Helm, but no details about its capabilities

- Brief mentions of the Voda people (blue shifters like Vaporeon)

- Odd census request from "TE" asking for crew details like species, birthplaces, and lineage

- Unopened letter signed "O.M." (Olivier Malton) warning about "royal's strange behavior" and requesting meeting at Bloody Clam in Baldur's Gate

- Oz recognized O.M. as former intermediary from Waterdeep who facilitated deals with Indrik before a job went wrong

Current dynamics:

Tav:

- Views leadership role seriously but worried about crew reliability

- Concerned about taking on empire with "damaged pirates"

- Trusts but uncertain about Oz's motivation and Dorum's chaos

Oz:

- Found peace with his past through recent experiences

- Inspired by Vaporeon, focused on rescuing her

- Trusts Tav's leadership and willing to support

- Less concerned with piracy, more with mission

Dorum:

- Never felt freer, thriving on adventure

- Starting to respect Tav's leadership despite natural contrarian nature

- Indifferent to larger conflicts, just enjoying freedom

- Learning to work as part of group while maintaining chaotic nature

All three are developing mutual trust despite very different personalities and motivations.

The transcript and notes don't contain any direct information about Eme or other sailors' current status. The most recent session focused on the capture of a Sodranian ship and the party's investigation of Crutchley's documents. Any previous information about Eme would need to be referenced from earlier sessions.

The transcript mentions Ridge returning with "MA" (likely Eme) from collecting the crew of The Larkin as planned. MA/Eme had a brief interaction where they thanked the party for getting them out of a tough spot, acknowledging they can come off as difficult but were grateful. Beyond that brief exchange, no other details about their current status or the other sailors are provided in this session.

Oz's crossbow progression:

1. Started with a basic "piece of shit" crossbow

2. Tav took it to Eliza the blacksmith

3. Eliza immediately discarded it, saying she had something better

4. Provided Oz with a +2 light crossbow, featuring:

- Much more refined woodworking

- Tighter, neater, straighter craftsmanship

- +9 to hit (up from previous basic crossbow)

- +6 base damage

- Better overall quality than his original weapon

The transcript doesn't show Oz having a specific name for his old crossbow. It's only referred to as a "piece of shit" by Eliza when she throws it away and replaces it with the better +2 crossbow.
