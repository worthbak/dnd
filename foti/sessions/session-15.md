### Game Session Recap

### Interrogation & New Intelligence

- Jotham Marcaster revealed Marcus family operations:
  - Hired by father to provide elven bodies to Waterdeep
  - Switched from finding dead bodies to kidnapping live elves
  - Bodies going to royals/those controlling high seas commerce
- Jotham is third son, low-status family member with limited knowledge
- Oz’s insight: Marcus family are high-status smugglers/kidnappers across Faerun
- Payment extracted: 1,100 gold (split 400 each) plus valuable items
- after extracting payment on-site, Tav executes Jotham and leaves him beheaded in his bedroom 

### Vapori Contact Through Dreams

- Oz made dream contact with captured Vapori during long rest
- Vapori’s status:
  - Imprisoned somewhere near ocean (likely lighthouse location)
  - Being held for unknown purpose, kept weak
  - Can reach out via consciousness-riding every few days
- Vision revealed hallway lined with elven bodies on pedestals
  - Bodies in various states of decay/aging (unusual for elves)
  - Blue-green crystal growth attaching them to walls
  - Same substance as essence found on ships
  - Operation appears decades-old based on body conditions

### Shopping & Equipment Upgrades

- Tav acquired Bracers of Archery (requires attunement) by trading looted antiques
- Purchased 6 healing potions (250 gold), thieves’ tools (50 gold)
