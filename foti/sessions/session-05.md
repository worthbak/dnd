- Ridge escapes on a nat 20
- marland crits on Dolrum, bringing him to 1hp
- Oz does an incredible job of fast-talking the last Sudranian thug (let's run away together) before killing him
- Marland attempts to bargain for his life after Tav knocks him out of his wereshark form - the crew is likely going to reject him, but Ardryll slits his throat before they can do anything, and slips into invisibility 
- the mage attempts to flee, and Tav zooms across the battlefield to kill them as they do
	- i need to check the rules for Zephyr - is that insane movement accurate? 
- Tav also rolls wildly with disadvantage to kill Ardryll as they're fleeing, invisibly in the doorway 
	- probably should have made this harder, but it's fine
- Ridge bargains for his life, and the crew spares him - Oz ties him up
- Tav groks the iron medallion on a high insight check, and also finds a dossier on Ardryll's body 
- Oz finds a room full of gold
	- Oz is a bit overwhelmed takes 1gp for his fallend ally (Endrik)
	- 16k gp, with dolrum taking the max 
	- Tav thinks she won't have to pay the rescued sailors 
	- dolrum uses the necromancer’s heart to resurrect the body of Marland and have it carry additional gold 
	- Crew is suspicious of the gold but finds nothing wrong with it after a lot of checking 
- gang takes a long rest outside of the temple
	- Dolrum tries to find beer supplies 
	- Oz has Ruga (picked him up after the battle)
	- Tav secures Ridge to a railing 
	- the gang inspects Ardryll's dossier, learning the leverage Sudrania thinks they have on them (tav is not concerned)
	- they go to bed, arranging their sleep in shifts to watch Ridge (and Vapori)
