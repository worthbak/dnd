	- Dolrum gave him some shit but eventually relented until he saw Oz sneaking in the captains quarters 
	- left on bad terms 
- [[Tav]] talked with [[Eme Isbland]], took her notes on keeping a lookout 
- spotted [[The Night's Fortune]] as they came out of the fog
- Pirates won the combat as expected, though more narrowly than expected
	- pirates suffered heavy losses 
- PCs woke up in pirates prison in [[Masaharro Lagoon]] on [[Kipsend Island]]
- Oz had his thieves tools hidden and used them to crack open the cell door
- [[Vapori Kelran]] disguised as Rickers Townsend gave them some water 
- party heard one group of prisoners shot at the end of the hallway 
- party started making some noise, prison guard came to investigate 
	- as he approached, Dolrum bashed him with the door and they killed him
- party opened the rest of the cells, freeing their six other allies (including Eme)
- entering the room at the other end of the hall, they were greeted by [[Marland 'Iron Chest' Crutchley]]
	- he laid out the deal for them
	- party accepted, all other sailors rejected 
- session ended with the party getting their gear back, plus on healing potion each 
- DM lessons
	- Pay more attention to prep notes - needed to have place names closer at hand
	- Check concentration in combat! 
	- pirate minions added spice to combat, but making the sailors tougher extended the fight 
	- Big baddies need multi attack 
	- Prep specific spells ahead of time 
	- Have a more specific plan of attack, especially for spellcasters
