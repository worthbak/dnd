### Combat Encounter

- Sudanian Navy ambush at market led by elven captain + 3 guards
- Aerial support: 3 Aracocra artificers animating combat statues
- Olivier’s smoke bomb opened engagement
- Tav’s lightning bolt eliminated multiple enemies instantly
- Dorum’s soul-consuming axe activated, claiming guard's soul
- All enemies killed or fled, party escaped to ship
	- Two Aracocra flew away before being killed 
- Party was able to sneak back to the ship undetected after the battle 

### Intelligence Gathered

- Note found on guard captain revealed:
  - Olivier Malton identified as “known terrorist”
  - Party wanted for Ardryl assassination and Royal Navy member deaths
  - Intelligence sourced directly from Waterdeep
  - Olivie not sure how the Sudranians knew she'd be at the market - Rutan or his circle likely compromised security

### Lantern Prison Information

- Olivier investigated lighthouse in a settlement north of Baldur’s Gate, Lathtarl's Lantern
- Former pirate haven converted to maximum security Navy installation
- 200 miles north, accessible by ship in ~1 day
- Strategicly defensible location for a prison: rocky shores, defendable, near Larloch the Lich’s territory
- High probability Vapori imprisoned there

### Lich Threat Assessment

- **Larloch**: ancient Netherese wizard, defeated and crashed in marshlands
- Said to command army of lesser liches
- Phylactery-based immortality - life force is stored in physical object(s), and lich cannot die while the object is intact 
- Larloch is immensly powerful - avoid direct confrontation recommended

### Next Steps

- Party planning voyage to Lantern Prison to rescue Vapori
- Olivie staying on ship temporarily
- Additional Baldur’s Gate activities to be planned via group chat
- Map and navigation details provided for northern route
