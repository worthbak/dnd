title: Session 14 - The Devil's Deal
---

Mon, 07 Jul 25

### Combat Overview

- Location: Margaster mansion courtyard in Baldur’s Gate
- Initial combatants: Dolrum vs 3 imps and 2 brute guards
- Secondary wave: 3 additional imps, 1 bearded devil, and Jotham Margaster
- Duration: Approximately 3-4 rounds of combat
- Casualties: Multiple imps, Jotham Margaster (temporarily)

### Key Actions & Damage

- Dolrum dealt critical damage multiple times:
	- Killed 2 imps in close combat
	- Landed killing blow on Jotham Margaster
- Tav executed multiple attacks:
	- Dealt 38 points of damage to devil in single turn
	- Failed athletics check attempting statue climb
- Oz suffered severe damage:
	- Took 43 points of cold damage from cone spell
	- Gained 4 levels of exhaustion
	- Currently immobile (-40 ft movement speed)
	- -8 penalty to all d20 rolls

### Devil’s Deal

- Terms: Devil offered to resurrect Jotham Margaster
- Cost: Control over Dolrum’s axe when rolling natural 1
	- If Dolrum rolls a Nat 1 on his attack, he then must make a Wisdom saving throw, DC 13. On a failure, Dolrum is Charmed by this Devil (a leutenant of Asmodeus), and must act as they wish. They repeat the save whenever they take damage, ending the condition on a success.
- Resolution:
	- Played blackjack for modified terms
	- Dolrum lost with a bust at 22
	- Axe became cursed (+2 weapon)
	- Weapon now bound to Dolrum
	- Light appears to be absorbed by the axe

### Loot & Resources

- Recovered from Jotham:
	- 20 gold pieces
	- One letter (unread)
	- Arcane focus (non-magical cane with ruby)
- Combat resources used:
	- Tav’s healing spirit spell
	- Multiple weapon attacks
	- Various movement abilities

### Strategic Implications

- Jotham Margaster alive but vulnerable (1HP)
- Team has potential leverage over Margaster family
- Oz severely weakened for next 4 long rests
- New cursed weapon could provide advantages/complications
- Party maintains possession of important documents

### Next Steps

- Potential interrogation of Jotham Margaster
- Need to investigate recovered letters
- Must manage Oz’s recovery period
- Session to resume mid-August after Worth’s Kilimanjaro trip
