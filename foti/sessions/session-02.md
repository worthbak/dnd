---

- gang listens to [[Marland 'Iron Chest' Crutchley]]
- [[Tav]] gets a nat20 insight

	- probably not "just" a treasure 
- Tav leaves the interaction, wants to find the remaining crew
	- others wanna escape 
	- party splits up
- Tav explores the pirate base
	- finds the mess, the armory
	- recons the ship (skeleton crew, some guards)
	- takes some food, attempts to take weapons but is stopped after a tense exchange 
- Oz/Dolrum find their way up the ladder to the cliff where [[Eme Isbland]] and the crew just arrived 
	- after some deliberation, Oz leaves to find Tav, and Dolrum tries to make some salmon (?) for the crew (he miserably fails and burns the shit out of the salmon)
	- Also at some point Dolrum calls Tav crazy or emotional or something
- eventually Oz finds Tav and they wind their way up to the surface with the crew
	- hatch closes behind them
	- they take a long rest 
- in the morning, they head out, not quite agreeing on their destination
	- Tav wants to scout the beach as a safe spot for the crew to hang while they look for help/escape, Dolrum wants to go for the treasure 
	- they move through the jungle, and have some idle conversation 
	- O/T learn how D got his weird armor 
	- Oz and Tav are forming a relationship, and Dolrum remains a weirdo 
- as they talk, they hear thuds and a shout for help
- find [[Vapori Kelran]]
	- help her, slaying the plants 
	- party takes minimal damage
	- Tav has a big Hail of Thorns hit
	- Dolrum does his thing, hitting a few times and also rolling a 2/3 reckless attack lol
	- Oz deals the killing blows with sneak attack on the big plant and a dagger attack ending the twig blight 
- after the battle, she explains what she's doing / lore dump
	- they agree to help her find [[The Obsidian Helm]], which she'll then use to summon some sea creatures, either to help them escape or to defeat the pirates 
- session ends with Tav openly / jokingly questioning Dolrum's assertion that they're all friends
