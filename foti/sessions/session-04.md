title: Session 4 - The Obsidian Helm and Crutchley's Betrayal
---

- they find 18 gold and 6 silver amongst the dead bodies 
- long rest
- [[Tav]] communes with [[Mielke]]
	- the goddess warns her to be wary of centralized power 
- next morning, Tav speaks with animals and talks to Jerry
	- learns his name, Ruga
	- not much else, other than Ruga is content 
	- [[Dolrum Redfist]] calls Ruga JR
- they move into the Chamber of [[The Obsidian Helm]]
	- meet The Librarian, as-expected interaction 
	- Tav asks if she should be worried about Vapori's quest to seek the helm, and The Librarian says yes, but it all depends on her and who she surrounds herself with 
	- they also don't notice anything magical among the tomes 
- they move toward the helm
	- they see the dolphin, and Tav immediately cures it 
	- The Guardian emerges, notes the lesson (care and justice must always come before power) and lets them take the helm
	- Dolrum stops Vapori from grabbing it, and they fret about her access to the power
	- ultimately, The Guardian reveals the true power of Ruga and his kind (Ruga transforms), and Ruga agrees to enforce a peaceful possession of the helm, along with his matron
- Vapori takes the helm, and they head out
	- Oz asks vapori about a **reward** as they leave, and she promises one, though she sounds disappointed in him
	- they find the Librarian arguing with [[Marland 'Iron Chest' Crutchley]] and [[Ardryll Wysastina]]
	- Ardryll makes her threats, but before she can even finish, Tav moves to act
- combat! 
	- they tend to focus fire on Crutchley, but deal solid damage to the rest of the enemies 
	- Ardryll goes invisible after taking decent damage 
	- Dolrum tosses around the boatswain like a ball, critting on a shove and entangling him in a nearby skeleton
	- Crutchley, after taking big damage, transforms into a [[Wereshark]], **blames the Voda for making him this way**, and engages Dolrum 
- we left it with Crutchley on death's door, and the party in decent shape (other than Vapori, who took a hit from the boatswain)
	- Dolrum defended her, dealing punishment damage to the boatswain and getting him away from V
